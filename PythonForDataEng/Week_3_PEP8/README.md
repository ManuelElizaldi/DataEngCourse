Reviewd the best practices for coding with python according to PEP8
    - Unit testing -> for testing functions
    - Static code analysis -> analysing code without running it
    - Modules, packages and libraries

# PEP8
    - 4 spaces is better than using tab
    - Use spaces to separate functions:
     ``` 
     def function_1 (a, b):
         c = a + b
         return c 

    def function_2 (a, b):
        c = a * b 
        return c
     ```
